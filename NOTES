** suggestion for auth issues
From =#emacs= WRT: how we can handle authentication issues moving forward.
: 10:44 < nicferrier> _schulte_: I think you should ignore the auth issues and just use a 
:                     client side cookie. that interface can always be improved.
: 10:44 < _schulte_> nicferrier: I vigorously agree

** Starting an elnode server
=nicferrier= suggests this script to launch an elnode server.

** Setup elnode
   :PROPERTIES:
   :results:  silent
   :END:
An abbreviated version of the instructions from
https://github.com/nicferrier/elnode.

1. clone locally to somewhere on the =load-path=.
   #+begin_src sh
   git clone git://github.com/nicferrier/elnode.git
   #+end_src
2. load up elnode
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (require 'elnode)
   #+end_src
3. define a simple handler function
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (defun simple-handler (httpcon)
       (elnode-http-start httpcon "200" '("Content-type" . "text/html"))
       (elnode-http-return httpcon "<html><b>HELLO!</b></html>"))
   #+end_src
4. start the server
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (elnode-start 'simple-handler :port 3333 :host "localhost")
   #+end_src
5. point your browser at elnode http://localhost:3333/
6. stop the server
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (elnode-stop 3333)
   #+end_src

** GSoC mid-term/final evaluations
*** How do evaluations work? 
Quote from GSoC [[http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2012/faqs][faq]]:

#+begin_quote
Google will pre-publish the evaluation questions for both students
and mentors. Mentors will fill out mid-term and final evaluations
for their students via the Google Summer of Code 2012 site. These
evaluations will be visible in the system to the mentor and the
mentoring organization's administrator(s). Students will fill out a
mid-term and final evaluation of their mentors online as well, and
their evaluations will only be visible in the system to the
mentoring organization's administrator(s). Program administrators
from Google will have access to all evaluation data.

Any student who does not submit an evaluation by the evaluation
deadline will fail that evaluation, regardless of the grade the
mentor gives the student. If a student submits his or her evaluation
on time but the mentor does not, then the student is  in an
"undecided" state until the program administrators can speak to the
mentor and determine the student's grade.

Students who fail the mid-term are immediately removed from the
program: it's not possible to fail the mid-term, stay in the
program, and then have a final evaluation.

In almost all cases, students will never see their mentor's
evaluation of their progress, nor will a mentor see a student's
evaluation of her/his mentorship. However, in the case where the
mentoring organization's administrator and a student's mentor are
one and the same, the student's evaluation will be shared with the
mentor. If you are a student in a situation where your mentor is
also your organization's administrator and you would like to discuss
an issue with the program, please contact the Google Summer of Code
program administrators. Organization administrators are expected to
review mid-term and final evaluations and to provide course
corrections where necessary.
In some cases, Google's program administrators may need to share the
results of evaluations with the student and mentor, such as to
arbitrate when payment should not be made. Should this need arise,
all parties will be notified in advance.

In the unlikely event that a mentor and organization administrator
do not agree on a student's grade for any evaluation, the decision
of the organization administrator is the final one.

In the also unlikely event that a student does not agree with a
mentoring organization's evaluation decision at either the midterm
or the final, the student may choose to submit his/her entire
project plan, timeline and code sample to Google's program
administrators. Google will choose an independent engineer to review
the code and arbitrate the decision. The decision of Google's
independent engineer is final.

Finally, any mentor who misses a deadline for an evaluation of his/
her student without notifying the program administrators beforehand
will not be allowed to attend the Google Summer of Code mentor
summit. Timely evaluations of Google Summer of Code students are
crucial to us.
